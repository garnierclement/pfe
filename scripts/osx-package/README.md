# Creating an OS X Installer package

Create a `.pkg` installer for Mac OS X in order to provide an user friendly GUI to install Manticore.

**WARNING This a work in progress and does not work yet out of the box**

## Tree structure and entry point

The main script is `create-pkg.sh` and the tree structure of this folder is the following

* `launchd/`  
	XML description files to register Manticore against `launchd`
* `scripts/`  
	`preinstall` and `postinstall` scripts for the .pkg generated by `pkgutil`
* `resources/`  
	resources folder used by `productbuild` and `distribution.xml` for the global package
* `out/`  
	temporary folder for `.pkg` files generated
* `package/`  
	copy of specific folders from the repository to be included in the main Manticore package for Mac OS X

## Pre and post install scripts

* `pkgbuild` looks for scripts in files called `preinstall` and `postinstall`
* You can use `set -e` to exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status (if applicable)
* Remember to `chmod +x` the scripts otherwise the installation will fail during the execution of the scripts
